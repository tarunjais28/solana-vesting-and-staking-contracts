2. Stake tokens
3. Claim tokens when the token lock period is over. After claim the token will be transferred to the recipient address mentioned in Claim Parameters.


#### Note: 

Vesting contract can be cancelled anytime by the admin account which has initialised it at the beginning and all the remaining tokens will be transferred from Smart Contract to the actual holder of the Tokens.
